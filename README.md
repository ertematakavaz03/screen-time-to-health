# Screen Time and Health: Does Technology Usage Reduce Physical Activities

## Description:
· I am Ertem Ata Kavaz (32790), currently studying at Sabanci University.    

· This is my Term Project for the DSA210 Course of the 2024-2025 Fall Semester.

## Motivation:
With the day-by-day increasing advancements in technology, our reliance on digital devices started to affect both health and productivity. This project aims to highlight the relationship between daily iPhone screen time and daily physical activity metrics, such as active energy expenditure and walking/running distance. The goal is to gain information on whether excessive digital device usage has negative effects on my physical activities and overall well-being. By collecting and analyzing data from my iPhone Screen Time feature and Apple Health application, I plan to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can guide healthier digital habits.


## Dataset:
*The dataset is composed of two main components:*

### 1) iPhone Screen Time Data:
· The data is collected from the iPhone's screen time feature.       

· Includes the detailed time history, consisting of both dates and hours. 

· Includes the daily total screen time of every date, and additionally has the most used app categories.

### 2) Health Metrics:
· The data is collected from the Apple Health app.   

· Includes the detailed time history, consisting of both dates and hours. 

· Includes the daily measurements of active energy(in kJ), walking/running distance(in km), and additionally has walking speed(in km/h).


## Project Plan:
### 1) Data Collection:
· Continue to document the Screen Time data of the previous week, every Monday, until the submission date.

· Apple's Health Data doesn't have the same issue since it records a larger range that should be sufficient. Also I will export the data using Apple supported application "Health Auto Export" which can export this data in both JSON and CSV format.

· Regularly check for inconsistencies and keep my routine lifestyle to avoid biases in the data.

### 2) Data Management:
· I will ensure consistency for both the "Screen Time Dataset" and "Health Dataset", which will share common attributes (ex: DD.MM.YYYY) for a more polished relation.

· I will arrange the data from both datasets on the same dates, and address the anomalies.

### 3) Data Analysis:
· Explore the patterns of "Screen Time" and "Health Metrics" parameters.

· Identify the relationship between the screen time categories and health metrics.

· Visualize the relations with the help of plots that have been mentioned in the lectures.

### 4) Data Comparison:
*Comparing the patterns of the dataset metrics according to...*

· Their patterns of the datasets, whether it's weekend or weekday.

· The dates with comparably high or low screen time and corresponding health metrics.

· Check if categories of the apps has effects on physical activity.

### 5) Data Report:
· Write a detailled report that collects all the findings, insights, and solutions I have found in a summarized whole.



## Possible Limitations Beforehand:

### 1) Historical Data Restrictions:
· Apple's Screen Time feature only provides up to 3 or 4 weeks before the current time, restricting the data needed to analyze long-term behavioral trends. This limits the range of the project and obligates me to record my data weekly.

### 2) Data Reliability:
· The accuracy of screen time and health metrics might not be consistent since there could be scenarios that could cause discrepancies. For example "going for a walk without taking my iPhone with me" or "using a laptop instead of my iPhone". 

### 3) Individual Bias:
· Since this project is an examination of my behavioral reactions, the findings may not be universal to broad populations.
